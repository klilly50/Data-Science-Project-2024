Can we predict number of checkouts in the first year since publication (need to determine when first checkout is)
Plot: how many times is a book checked out in a year since publication

How popular is a given genre, relative to how much of that genre is in the catalog
Plot: number of checkouts per title by genre whisker or violin plot

What does the number of checkouts (in the first year) tell us about the numbers of ratings after the first year [need some way of accessing ratings information]

Look at physical vs digital checkouts over time. It would be interesting to look at genre effects.
Plot: books and ebooks over time
